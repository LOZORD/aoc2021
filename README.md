# Advent of Code 2021

Here are my solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

This year, I decided to learn (and use!) some Kotlin.
Hopefully it goes better than Rust last year `:P`.

I've been running `.kts` files via:

```bash
kotlinc -script main.kts < /tmp/input.txt
```

And running `.kt` files via:

```bash
kotlinc main.kt -include-run -d /tmp/main.jar

java -jar /tmp/main.jar < /tmp/input.txt
```

Enjoy!
